% Simple facts about what the monkey needs to do
action(get_chair, 'Monkey gets the chair').
action(move_chair_under_bananas, 'Monkey moves the chair under the bananas').
action(get_stick, 'Monkey picks up the stick').
action(stand_on_chair, 'Monkey stands on the chair').
action(knock_bananas, 'Monkey knocks the bananas down with the stick').

% Rule: the sequence of actions to get the bananas
sequence_of_actions([get_chair, move_chair_under_bananas, get_stick, stand_on_chair, knock_bananas]).

% Rule to print each action in the sequence
print_actions([]).
print_actions([Action|Rest]) :-
    action(Action, Description),
    writeln(Description),
    print_actions(Rest).

% Solve the problem by printing all actions in the correct sequence
solve :-
    sequence_of_actions(Actions),
    print_actions(Actions).
